## Quotations 
“Right of privacy and property, physical welfare, informed consent, trust, and accountability. What values count? Who decides? Are values relative? Are some values universal, but expressed differently across culture and context? Does technology have values? How values become implicated in design. Can values conflicts? How HCI designers working within a corporate structure and with a mandate to generate revenue bring values and ethics into their design”
